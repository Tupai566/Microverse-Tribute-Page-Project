            <h3>Here's a timeline of Nelson Mandela's life:</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1918</b> - Born on 18 July, in the village of Mvezo in Umtata.</li>
                    <li><b>1933</b> - Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.</li>
                    <li><b>1937</b> - He moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice.</li>
                    <li><b>1939</b> - Mandela began work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution of approximately 150 students in Alice, Eastern Cape</li>
                    <li><b>1943</b> - He passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland.</li>
                    <li><b>1944</b> - Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC president Alfred Bitini Xuma on the subject at his home in Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, with Lembede as president and Mandela as a member of its executive committee.</li>
                    <li><b>1947</b> - Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe.</li>
                    <li><b>1950</b> - Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL.</li>
                    <li><b>1952</b> - Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act and stood trial as one of the 21 accused among them Moroka, Sisulu and Yusuf Dadoo in Johannesburg.</li>
                    <li><b>1956</b> - He received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it.</li>
                    <li><b>1961</b> - six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of "high treason", since they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.</li>
                    <li><b>1994</b> - The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally.</li>
                    <li><b>1998</b> - Mandela was appointed secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban.</li>
                    <li><b>2004</b> - Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be "few better gifts for us" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid.</li>
                    <li><b>2013</b> - Mandela died at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family.</li>
